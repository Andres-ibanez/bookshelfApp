## Installation

├──Type *npm install* to install all dependencies.
├──Type *npm start* to run the app locally.
└──Open *http://localhost:3000* to view it in the browser.

## Usage

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

├── Currently Reading
├── Want to Read
└── Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
